<h2>Professional Objective</h2>

<p>With over 6000 NM logged, I am eager to embark on a career in the yachting industry as a Deckhand, 
    where I can channel my love for the ocean, enthusiasm for water sports; commitment to hard work into 
    exploring diverse opportunities and contributing to the success of yacht operations.
     I thrive in positions where I can not only put my skill set into place but also learn new skills and adapt to new challenges.
     Passionate and dedicated individual, fervently in love with the ocean and water sports, 
     particularly surfing as well as being provincially represented for bodyboarding. 
     Known for kindness, friendliness, and a strong work ethic, I thrive in collaborative environments.</p>
